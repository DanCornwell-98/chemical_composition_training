Chemical-Composition
====================

This Python module offers helper functions to calculate chemical compositions
of peptides and their modifications.

Originally, the chemical-composition class was part of the [Ursgal](https://github.com/ursgal/ursgal) 
and [pyQms](https://github.com/pyQms/pyqms) modules.
For the sake of unification and modularity, it is now a standalone repository.
